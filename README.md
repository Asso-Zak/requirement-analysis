# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository focuses on **Requirement Analysis** in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC).  
It explains the concept, importance, key activities, types of requirements, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria using a property booking management system as an example.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, understanding, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.  
It ensures that the software solution meets user needs and business objectives.

### Importance in the SDLC:
- Provides clarity on what needs to be built.  
- Reduces misunderstandings between stakeholders and developers.  
- Forms the foundation for design, development, and testing.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is critical in the SDLC because it:  
1. **Prevents Scope Creep**: Ensures that only agreed-upon features are developed.  
2. **Improves Project Planning**: Helps allocate time, budget, and resources effectively.  
3. **Enhances Quality**: Ensures the system meets user expectations in terms of functionality, performance, and reliability.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
The main activities are:  

- **Requirement Gathering**: Collect initial needs from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, or workshops.  
- **Requirement Elicitation**: Refine and expand requirements using techniques such as brainstorming and prototyping.  
- **Requirement Documentation**: Create clear documents like Software Requirement Specifications (SRS) and use cases.  
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**: Analyze requirements for feasibility and consistency; create models/diagrams to visualize.  
- **Requirement Validation**: Review requirements with stakeholders to ensure completeness and accuracy.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Define **what the system should do**.  
- **Examples (Booking System):**  
  - User registration and login  
  - Property search and filtering  
  - Booking and payment processing  

### Non-functional Requirements
- Define **how the system should perform**.  
- **Examples (Booking System):**  
  - Page load time under 2 seconds  
  - Secure login and encrypted transactions  
  - System uptime of 99.9%

## Use Case Diagrams
**Definition:** Use Case Diagrams show interactions between users (actors) and the system.  
They visualize system functionality and help validate requirements.  

**Example Diagram:**

 />


**Actors:**  
- Guest/User  
- Admin  
- Payment System  

**Use Cases:**  
- Register/Login  
- Search Properties  
- View Property Details  
- Book Property  
- Make Payment  
- Add/Update Property Listing  
- Approve Booking

## Acceptance Criteria
**Definition:** Acceptance Criteria are conditions a software feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders.  

**Why Important?**  
- Provide measurable standards for “done.”  
- Align developers, testers, and stakeholders.  
- Reduce ambiguity in requirements.  

**Example (Checkout Feature in Booking System):**  
- User can select a property and proceed to checkout.  
- System must securely process payment.  
- Confirmation email is sent within 1 minute after booking.
