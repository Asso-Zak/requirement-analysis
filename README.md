# Requirement Analysis in Software Development
## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding what a software system should do. It helps developers know exactly what to build.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- **Clarity:** Makes sure everyone understands the project.
- **Planning:** Helps plan resources and time.
- **Quality:** Ensures the system works correctly and meets user needs.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
- **Requirement Gathering:** Collect needs from stakeholders.
- **Requirement Elicitation:** Ask questions, use interviews or workshops.
- **Requirement Documentation:** Write all requirements clearly.
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling:** Organize and model the requirements.
- **Requirement Validation:** Check that the requirements are correct and complete.

## Types of Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- What the system should do. Example: Users can register, search properties, and book rooms.

### Non-functional Requirements
- How the system should perform. Example: System loads in under 2 seconds, secure login.

## Use Case Diagrams
Use case diagrams show how users interact with the system. They help visualize features.
